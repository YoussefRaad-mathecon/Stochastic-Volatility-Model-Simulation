# Stochastic Volatility Model Option Pricing
This repository contains my code for simulation of asset prices under the Heston model and other numerical approximations. The code is mostly avaliable in python.

## HestonModel.py class
This class contains: Simulation, Monte Carlo Pricing and Exact Pricing in the Heston model.

### Simulations
The implemented Monte Carlo simulation schemes (so far):
- Euler
- Milstein
- Truncated-Gaussian (TG)
- Truncated-Gaussian: Martingale-corrected (TG+M)
- Quadratic-Exponential (QE)
- Quadratic-Exponential: Martingale-corrected (QE-M)
- Broadie and Kaya Drift Interpolation
### Exact Pricing
The implemented exact pricing 
- Heston's Original
- Heston's (Stable) Original
- Carr-Madan.
